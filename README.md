# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

For this project I have to create a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Below the link to the original data:

The tidy dataset is created by the R script run_analysis.R:

•	Download the data with download.file

•	Use read.table to read the data

•	Merge the data with cbind

•	Create a tidy dataset

•	The write.table function is used to write the tidy dataset to an output file
